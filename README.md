# VSDIAT_Advanced_physical_design_Using_OPENLANE_skywater130pdk
This repo is a part of the partial fulfilment of the 5-days "Advanced Physical Design Workshop using OpenLANE using SKY130" workshop, powered by VLSI System Design and sponsored by Efabless Corporation

#Tools Used in the workshop
All the tools used in this workshop, were open source:
* Yosys and ABC: For Synthesis
* Magic : For Layout
* Ngspice : For Circuit Design and Simulation
* OpenSTA: For Static Timing Analysis(STA)
All of these were integrated in the OpenLane flow which is why OpenLane is used in this workshop, OpenLane flow is in the following: Image Courtesy (OpenLane/Efabless)
